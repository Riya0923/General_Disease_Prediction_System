\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  The General Disease Prediction System is an innovative technology that uses advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to predict the occurrence of diseases in individuals.
  
  This system is designed to analyze various factors such as age, medical history, lifestyle habits, and environmental conditions to provide accurate predictions

\begin{frame}{How it Works}
		The General Disease Prediction System works by collecting and analyzing large amounts of data from various sources such as medical records, genetic testing, and environmental sensors.
		The system then uses machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations between different variables to accurately predict the likelihood of developing certain diseases.

\section{General Disease Prediction System}

\begin{frame}{General Disease Prediction System}
	Artificial Intelligence made computer more intelligent and can
	enable the computer to think. AI study consider machine
	learning as subfield in numerous research work. Different
	analysts feel that without learning, insight can't be created.
	There are numerous kinds of Machine Learning Techniques
	like Unsupervised, Semi Supervised, Supervised,
	Reinforcement, Evolutionary Learning and Deep Learning.
	These learnings are used to classify huge data very fastly. So
	we use K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Convolutional neural
	network (CNN) machine learning algorithm for fast
	classification of big data and accurate prediction of disease.
	Because medical data is increasing day by day so usage of that
	for predicting correct disease is crucial task but processing big
	data is very crucial in general so data mining plays very
	important role and classification of large dataset using
	machine learning becomes so easy.

\section{\textbf{Diabetes Prediction System}}

\begin{frame}{Diabetes Prediction System}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Diabetes is one of deadliest diseases in the
		world. It is not only a disease but also a creator of
		different kinds of diseases like heart attack,
		blindness, kidney diseases, etc.
	    Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is defined as a group of metabolic
		disorders mainly caused by abnormal insulin
		secretion and/or action. Insulin deficiency results in
		elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and
		impaired metabolism of carbohydrates, fat and
		proteins.
		\item There are two major clinical types : \\\ 
		Type 1 diabetes (T1D) \\\
		Type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
		\item According to the etiopathology
		of the disorder. T2D appears to be the most common
		form of diabetes,mainly characterized by insulin resistance. 
		\item The main
		causes of T2D include lifestyle, physical activity,
		dietary habits and heredity, whereas T1D is thought
		to be due to autoimmunological destruction of the
		Langerhans islets hosting pancreatic-β cells.
			
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Working Principle}
	\begin{itemize}
	      \item Machine learning is the scientific field
	      dealing with the ways in which machines learn from
	      experience.The purpose of
	      machine learning is the construction of computer
	      systems that can adapt and learn from their experiences.
	      \item We have developed a system using data
	      mining which has the ability to predict whether the
	      patient has diabetes or not.
	      \item Furthermore, predicting
	      the disease early leads to treating the patients before
	      it becomes critical. Data mining has the ability to
	      extract hidden knowledge from a huge amount of
	      diabetes-related data.
	      \item The aim of this research is to develop a system
	      which can predict the diabetic risk level of a patient
	      with a higher accuracy. This research has focused on
	      developing a system based on three classification
	      methods namely, Support Vector Machine, Logistic
	      regression and Artificial Neural Network algorithms. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{\textbf{Lung Cancer Prediction System}}

\begin{frame}{Lung Cancer Prediction System}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lung cancer is a harmful disease that causes a huge number of
	deaths globally. The primal encounter of lung cancer is
	necessary to decrease the mortality rate of patients. Thus it is a
	great challenge encountered by doctors and researchers to
	detect and diagnose lung cancer. Detection of lung cancer can
	be done by using medical images such as computed
	tomography, chest X-ray; MRI scans, etc., ML approaches
	recognize the main characteristics of complex lung cancer
	datasets. A CAD (Computer-Aided Diagnosis) was developed
	in the early 1980s to enhance the survival rate and efficiency
	that aid the doctors in interpreting medical images. Some of the
	machine learning algorithms that have a profound impact in
	health care are decision trees, linear regression, random forest,
	SVM, naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbors and so 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Working Principle}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A prototype lung cancer disease prediction system is
		developed using data mining classification techniques. 
		\item The system extracts hidden knowledge from a historical lung
		cancer disease database. 
		\item The most effective model to predict patients with Lung cancer disease appears to be
		Naïve Bayes followed by IF-THEN rule, Decision Trees and Neural Network.
		\item Decision Trees results are easier to read and interpret. 
		\item The drill through feature to access detailed patients’ profiles is only available in Decision Trees	
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{\textbf{Heart Disease Prediction System}}

\begin{frame}{Heart Disease Prediction System}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Heart disease, alternatively known as cardiovascular disease, encases various conditions that impact the heart and is the primary basis of death worldwide over the span of the past few decades.
		\item  It associates many risk factors in heart disease and a need of the time to get accurate, reliable, and sensible approaches to make an early diagnosis to achieve prompt management of the disease. 
		\item Data mining is a commonly used technique for processing enormous data in the healthcare domain. Researchers apply several data mining and machine learning techniques to analyse huge complex medical data, helping healthcare professionals to predict heart disease. 
		\item This project will be presenting various attributes related to heart disease, and the model on basis of supervised learning algorithms as Naïve Bayes, decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, and random forest algorithm.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Working Principle}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For predicting heart attack, significantly 15 attributes are listed
		and with basic data mining technique other approaches e.g. ANN,Time Series, Clustering and Association Rules, soft computing approaches etc. can also be incorporated. 
		\item The outcome of predictive data mining technique on the same dataset reveals that
		Decision Tree outperforms and some time Bayesian classification is having similar accuracy as of decision tree but other predictive methods like KNN, Neural Networks, Classification based on clustering are not performing well.
		\item Decision Tree and Bayesian Classification further improves after applying genetic algorithm to reduce the actual data size to get the optimal subset of attribute sufficient for heart disease prediction.
